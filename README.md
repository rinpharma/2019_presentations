<strong>Chase Clark</strong> (<i>University of Illinois</i>), Your Missing Step in Reproducible R Programming: Continuous Deployment<details><summary>Abstract</summary></p>The past few years have shown vast improvements in workflows for reproducible and distributable research within the R ecosystem. At satRday Chicago everyone in the audience said they used R Markdown, however only one person raised their hand when asked if they could associate their reports back to the code version that generated it. Since continuous integration is quickly becoming commonplace in the R community, continuous deployment (CD) is a logical and easy step to add to your workflow to enhance reproducibility. I will demo associating R Markdown to the code version that produced it and automating the build and release of both executable and cloud-based Shiny apps. Finally, an announcement of the electricShine package for creating Electron based Shiny apps will highlight the power of using CD with production-level Shiny apps.</p><br>[Slides](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma2019program/tree/master/talks_folder/2019-Clark-Continuous_Deployment.pdf)</details><br>
<strong>Elena Rantou</strong> (<i>FDA</i>), Using R for Generic Drug Evaluation and SABE R-package for Assessing Bioequivalence of Topical Dermatological Products<details><summary>Abstract</summary></p>Determination of bioequivalence (BE), a crucial part of the evaluation of generic drugs, may depend on clinical endpoint studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of bioavailability, and In-Vitro tests, among others. Additionally, in reviewing Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA), FDA reviewers often analyze safety studies and perform various kinds of simulations. A growing, vibrant group of statisticians in the Office of Biostatistics, CDER/FDA has adopted R for both their routine tasks and to address numerous scientific questions that are received in the form of internal consults. During the past 5 years, we have used R to run power simulations; generate the distribution of certain statistics of interest; assess the similarity of and cluster amino-acid sequences as well as, derive the distribution of the molecular weight of such sequences of a certain length; and determine the validity of data sets categorized for genotoxicity. R-package SABE was developed to accompany a new statistical test, used to assess BE of topical dermatological products when data for evaluation come from the In-Vitro Permeation Test (IVPT) [1]. BE tests consider comparisons between a Test (usually generic) and a Reference (RLD) product under a replicate study design. A function that assesses BE of a Test and a Reference formulation uses a mixed scaled criterion for the PK metrics AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Cmax (maximum concentration).</p><br>[Slides](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma2019program/tree/master/talks_folder/2019-Rantou-Generic_Drug_Evaluation_Bioequivalence_Topical_Dermatological_Products.pdf)</details><br>
<strong>Eric Nantz</strong> (<i>Eli Lilly</i>), Creating and reviving Shiny apps with {golem}<details><summary>Abstract</summary></p>Developing Shiny applications that meet design goals, easily deploy to multiple platforms, and contain easily maintainable components (all while adhering to best practices) is typically a difficult endeavor. Until recently, there has not been a tool addressing the optimal development workflow and construction of Shiny apps. The {golem} package by Think-R offers an opinionated framework for creating a Shiny app as a package, with {usethis}-like functionality to add a diverse set of capabilities. In this presentation, I will share how {golem} enables a robust standard for Shiny development and how it magically brought a dormant application back to life.</p><br>[Slides](https://rpodcast.gitlab.io/golem_rpharma2019/#1)</details><br>
<strong>Jeannine Fisher</strong> (<i>Metrum</i>), Leveraging multiple R tools to make effective pediatric dosing decisions<details><summary>Abstract</summary></p>R Shiny apps allow for dynamic, interactive, real-time integration of knowledge within a drug-development program to support decision making. Here, an R Shiny app was used to explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of different dosing regimens of the anti IL-17 human mAb Cosentyx? (secukinumab) in pediatric patients. Secukinumab has been studied and approved to treat psoriasis in adult patients. Models which describe the dose-exposure-response relationships in adults (Lee et al., Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2019 and FDA, Medical Reviews BLA 125504, 2015) were used in the mrgsolve simulation package to explore these relationships in pediatric patients. The prior adult knowledge, used in conjunction with the computational infrastructure leveraged through R, the Shiny app, mrgsolve, and Rcpp, allows researchers to explore various dosing regimens in a difficult-to-study patient population. The tools and approaches described here have been routinely used to support regulatory interactions (ex. PIP) involving pediatric dosing.</p><br>[Slides](https://github.com/rinpharma/rinpharma2019program/tree/master/talks_folder/2019-Fisher-Pediatric_Dosing_Decisions.pdf)</details><br>
